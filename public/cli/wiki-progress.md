# Wiki progress and remaining work

Reviewed 2026-09-17 against `feat/wiki-1443-followups`, commit `85315404`,
and live [draft PR #1454](https://github.com/openonion/connectonion/pull/1454).
The PR targets **1.8.7**, with no confirmed release date. The implementation
is a local, single-owner Markdown notebook.

## Available functionality

| Capability | Entry point | Evidence / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial source discovery and ranked People/Project/Skills map | `co wiki init` | Installed-skill skeletons are created before the model stage. People/project ranking remains a Skill workflow; init now hands off to a separate investigation stage; full live-account initialization still needs acceptance. |
| Deterministic discovery and page skeletons | `map-skills`, `scan people`, `scan projects`, `stub person`, `stub project` | `map-skills` creates source-linked installed-skill pages without executing or copying runtime skills; reruns preserve page prose. Explicit skill roots are supported. |
| Existing-person investigation | `people`, `investigate people/alice.md` | Collects mail/session evidence, digests large inputs, updates the existing page; earlier live owner run is recorded in acceptance evidence. |
| Incremental updates and corrections | `subscribe`, `sync`, `unsubscribe` | Checkpoints, no-op handling, failure accounting and writer locking exist. |
| Derived decisions and principles | `abstract` | Command and Skill exist; whole lifecycle acceptance remains incomplete. |
| Background updates | `start`, `stop` | macOS launchd runs scheduled sync. Does not yet alternate sync with unfinished investigations. |
| Reading and diagnostics | `list`, `show`, `search`, `open`, `status`, `logs`, `usage`, `doctor` | HTML is a generated snapshot; reopen to refresh. No hosted login/admin UI. |
| Shared model execution | All model stages use `co ai` | Codex, Claude Code and COAI adapters exist. Claude subscription path lacks live acceptance. |
| Attachments | Investigation collection | PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ICS, HTML and text readers exist; errors are reported. |

## Progress and performance evidence

On 2026-09-17, 242 focused Wiki, CLI, shared-harness and default-Skill tests
passed in 3.46 seconds locally. These use fixtures; their runtime measures
the test suite, not real Wiki generation speed.

The September 15 acceptance record contains a real synthetic Luna run:
extraction used 80,897 input / 1,576 output tokens; maintenance used 204,541
input / 3,660 output tokens. Cached input was 50,688 and 150,016 respectively
and is already included in input. A separate small Gemini extraction reported
$0.04813312. These are individual observations, not per-user pricing or a
full-mailbox estimate. Maintenance cost is still material even with small
source inputs. See [dated acceptance evidence](../testing/wiki-acceptance.md).

Live GitHub checks at the reviewed commit are not green: Python 3.10–3.13
test jobs, the blog gate and release metadata gate report failures. The
inspected Python 3.10 job reports 10,354 passed, 23 skipped and two failures:
`test_ai_forwards_full_access_options` and
`test_ai_forwards_json_and_resume_options`. Both expected calls omit the new
`timeout=600` argument. Both failures reproduce locally; this review updates
those expectations without changing runtime behavior. Other Python jobs must
be rechecked after the fix; their causes are not inferred from the 3.10 log.

The blog gate asks for a clearer narrative about the hidden token cost, rather
than a verification checklist. The metadata gate requires explicit
`Proposed target version` and `Estimated release window` fields in the PR body.
These remain release follow-ups; local changes do not make remote CI green.

## Remaining product work

The two largest automation gaps are budget enforcement and scheduling the
unfinished investigation queue. Source completeness and release acceptance
are additional work, so this is not a claim that only two tasks remain.

| Priority | Work | Completion criteria |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Enforce real provider budgets across init, investigate, extract, maintain and abstract | Shared meter/reservation before work; known and unknown usage distinguished; stop/resume behavior verified. Current attempt/input limits do not enforce 2% initial, 1% daily or $1 spending limits. |
| P0 | Alternate incremental maintenance and unfinished investigations | Persist per-notebook progress, prevent concurrent writers, preserve retryable work on failure, and respect the shared budget. |
| P1 | Complete source listing | Paginate beyond 200 messages per weekly investigation window and own-mail sent history; prove no loss with a busy-window fixture. |
| P1 | Connect Jira discovery/auth | Explicit source selection, successful authorized retrieval, visible partial/failure state. |
| P1 | End-to-end initialization and daily lifecycle | Verify one authorized account through init, update, correction, scheduled continuation and stop; record elapsed time, usage and coverage. |
| Release | Repair remaining gates and refresh acceptance | CI at the resulting commit, live Claude evidence if advertised, cost narrative, release metadata. |

Project page templates now include `Architecture map` (evidence-backed ASCII module/data-flow diagrams) and `Latest issues` (dated symptoms, impact, status and evidence), separate from the broader action list. Mapping leaves these Unknown until investigated.

Project pages now lead with one plain-language purpose sentence, an ASCII user-flow overview and a try-it entry point. Ownership, role-specific getting-started links and dated decision rationale follow the current status/issues; technical architecture and paths live farther down. Both map skeletons and investigation use this same template. Existing pages are preserved by mapping and upgraded when investigated.

Skill catalog templates now prioritize usefulness, latest observed status, example outputs and minimal invocation. Detailed history/statistics distinguish process exit, task completion and reviewed quality, with sample counts and coverage. Run-log collection remains unimplemented; metadata-only maps leave these sections unverified.

Skill run evidence collection now dispatches from `co wiki investigate skills/catalog/...`: it reads retained co eval slash-command summaries, counts unique run/turn attempts, and links per-run inputs, outputs and evaluations. No mail/model is invoked. Tool-based invocation, other harness logs, installed-version attribution and automatic goal/artifact review remain unsupported.

## 1.8.7 consolidated integration — 2026-09-19

#1454 now consolidates installed-skill mapping, project and skill page templates,
retained skill-run evidence, and the #1587 reader repairs. Deterministic init
builds all three maps; investigation is separate. Its new candidate path removes
the write-existing-file loop, retains exact input in a readable representation,
normalizes legacy headings, and rejects structural/citation errors before replacement.
Concrete person-template facts were removed. See `wiki-187-checklist.md` for the
requirement map, acceptance evidence and remaining decisions. Historical queue
failure remains failure: no batch was restarted or accepted retroactively.
