# WhatsApp CLI (`co whatsapp`)

Turn a WhatsApp number into a directory of files. Every message the number
receives — including in groups a person created and added it to — becomes one
line in a log and one file in a queue; anything that can read a file can answer
it. The same nine verbs as `co feishu`, against a different platform.

```bash
pip install 'connectonion[whatsapp]'
brew install libmagic                  # a system library pip cannot supply; see Setup
co whatsapp listen                     # scan the QR once; every message → ~/.co/inbox/whatsapp/
co whatsapp receive                    # next message as one JSON line
echo "on it" | co whatsapp reply 3EB0A1
co whatsapp consume -- claude -p       # one command per message, stdout is the reply
```

## Read this before you link a number

This links a **companion device**, the same mechanism as WhatsApp Web: the
phone stays the account, and this becomes one of the four devices it allows
alongside itself. That has two consequences worth knowing before you scan
anything.

**Use a number you have dedicated to this.** Never a personal number, never an
employee's main number. A linked device sees every chat the number is in, so
pointing it at a personal number puts that person's private conversations
through your queue and, if you wire an agent to it, through a model. Buy a SIM
or use a spare handset.

**WhatsApp's terms do not cover this.** Automated use of the consumer client is
against the Business Messaging Policy, and Meta bans numbers for it. Nobody can
promise you a number will survive. That is the price of the one thing the
official API cannot do, and it is why this is an extra you opt into rather than
something installed by default.

## Why not the official API

The WhatsApp Cloud API is the supported route and it is genuinely better —
until you need groups. It cannot join a group a human created; there is no join
endpoint at all. It can only create groups itself, they cap at 8 participants,
and creating them at all requires an Official Business Account, which is
granted on merit and filed through a solutions provider. If your use is "a bot
sits in the customer group we already made and answers when we @ it", the Cloud
API has no path to it. This does.

Use the Cloud API instead whenever you can: one-to-one customer messaging,
notifications, anything you would ship to your own users.

## Setup

```bash
pip install 'connectonion[whatsapp]'

# …and libmagic, which the extra cannot install for you:
brew install libmagic        # macOS
apt install libmagic1        # Debian/Ubuntu
dnf install file-libs        # Fedora/RHEL
pip install python-magic-bin # Windows (this one does bundle the library)

co whatsapp listen
```

The extra installs neonize, which imports `python-magic` — a *binding* to the
system library `libmagic`. pip installs the binding; the library it binds to
comes from the OS. So `pip install 'connectonion[whatsapp]'` succeeds and the
first `co whatsapp listen` still stops, with libmagic named and the command for
your platform. Install it once and it does not come back.

A QR code appears in the terminal. On the phone, **Settings → Linked devices →
Link a device**, and scan it. The pairing is stored at
`~/.co/inbox/whatsapp/session.db` (or wherever `WHATSAPP_SESSION` points) and
that file *is* the linked device: copy it and you have copied the device,
delete it and the device is unlinked. It is created mode 0700 with the rest of
the inbox.

```bash
co whatsapp check                # says what is missing, if anything
```

`check` exits 3 and names the missing item: the extra, an unlinked device, or a
bundled protocol implementation old enough to start failing.

## The directory

```
~/.co/inbox/whatsapp/
├── received.jsonl      every message ever received
├── sent.jsonl          every reply
├── new/                unread, one file each
├── cur/                taken by a consumer
├── outbox/             replies waiting for the listener (see below)
├── session.db          the linked device
└── log
```

Identical to every other provider — [DD-063](../design-decisions/063-one-directory-three-verbs.md)
has the interface, and [feishu.md](feishu.md) documents the verbs in full,
because they behave the same here.

`chat` is the group JID (`1203630000000@g.us`) for a group message and the
peer's JID (`447700900123@s.whatsapp.net`) for a direct one, so `reply` lands
where the question was asked either way.

## Groups: when the bot answers

In a group, `mentioned` is true when the message @-mentions the linked number,
replies to something it said, or writes its number in the text. In a direct
message it is always true. Set `mention_only` on the channel and the agent
answers only those; leave it off and it answers everything in the group.

Until the connection is up the number is not yet known, so nothing in a group
counts as addressed. A `mention_only` channel stays quiet for that moment
rather than answering everyone in it.

## Sending needs the listener running

WhatsApp allows one connection per linked device. There is no REST endpoint to
post to — every byte rides the socket `co whatsapp listen` is holding, and a
second process opening the same session would present the same device identity
and take the connection away from the listener.

So `co whatsapp send` and `co whatsapp reply` do not connect. They write the
text to `outbox/`, the listener picks it up and sends it, and the answer comes
back the same way. With no listener running, `send` waits 30 seconds and then
says so:

```
No listener answered in 30s. WhatsApp allows one connection per linked
device, so sending goes through the listener rather than opening a second
one. Next: co whatsapp listen
```

This also means `send` and `reply` work without the extra installed. Only
`listen` needs it.

## The protocol snapshot

The extra pins `neonize` exactly rather than with `>=`. The wheel carries a
compiled snapshot of whatsmeow's WhatsApp protocol implementation, so a version
bump is a protocol change and deserves to be a deliberate one.

The flip side is that the snapshot goes stale, and WhatsApp changing something
under an old one fails in ways that do not name themselves. `check` reads the
snapshot's date out of the shared library and says so once it is more than six
months old.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_SESSION` | `~/.co/inbox/whatsapp/session.db` | Where the linked device is stored |
| `CO_INBOX_HOME` | `~/.co/inbox` | Moves the whole inbox root, every provider with it |
