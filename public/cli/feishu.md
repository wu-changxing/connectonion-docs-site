# Feishu and Lark CLI (`co feishu`, `co lark`)

Turn a Feishu bot into a directory of files. Every message someone sends the
bot becomes one line in a log and one file in a queue; anything that can read
a file can answer it. `co lark` is the same tool against Lark (Feishu outside
China) with its own credentials.

This calls Feishu directly through the official SDK's long connection. It
dials out, so it runs on a laptop behind NAT with no public address, no
OpenOnion credential, and nothing billed.

## Setup

```bash
pip install lark-oapi
co auth feishu
```

`co auth feishu` prints a QR code and a link. Scan it with Feishu or Lark,
approve, and the application exists — in your own tenant, owned by you — with
its credentials written to `~/.co/keys.env`.

**Already have a bot?** `co auth feishu --app-id cli_…` authorizes that one
instead of creating a new one, so it keeps the groups it is already in and the
permissions already granted to it — which is usually what you want, since a new
application is in no group at all. If `lark-cli` is installed, `co auth feishu`
lists the application ids it has configured so you can copy one. It reads only
the ids: the secret beside them is a keychain reference, and copying that into
a plaintext file would be a downgrade (#1497). There is no developer console to
visit and nothing to copy. It starts on Feishu and moves to Lark by itself if
that is where your tenant lives, so there is nothing to choose first either.

Then add the bot to a group and @ it, or send it a direct message.

```bash
co feishu check                  # says what is missing, if anything
```

`check` exits 3 and names the missing item.

<details>
<summary>Using an application you already have</summary>

`co auth feishu` always creates a new application, because Feishu has no API
that lists the ones you own. To use an existing one, configure it by hand:

1. At <https://open.feishu.cn/app> (Lark: <https://open.larksuite.com/app>),
   enable the **bot** capability.
2. Under *Permissions* add `im:message.group_at_msg:readonly` (group messages
   that @ the bot), `im:message:send_as_bot` (reply), and
   **`im:message.group_msg`** — that last one is what lets the listener read
   back a gap after a disconnect, and without it recovery cannot run at all.
   It is a sensitive scope: it lets the application read every message in the
   groups it is in. Add `im:message.p2p_msg:readonly` if people will message
   the bot directly.
3. Under *Events*, choose **long connection** and subscribe to
   `im.message.receive_v1`. No request URL is needed.
4. Publish it to your tenant, then write its credentials into
   `~/.co/keys.env` — `co env set` refuses these two names by default, because
   a hand-typed app secret came from somewhere it cannot check, so say where
   they came from:

   ```bash
   co env set FEISHU_APP_ID cli_xxx --from-console
   co env set FEISHU_APP_SECRET xxx --from-console --secret
   ```

   `--secret` encrypts the value rather than leaving it in the file. Or write
   them with an editor:

   ```dotenv
   FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxx
   FEISHU_APP_SECRET=xxx
   # Lark uses its own pair
   LARK_APP_ID=cli_yyy
   LARK_APP_SECRET=yyy
   ```

</details>

## The directory

```text
~/.co/inbox/feishu/
├── received.jsonl   every message received, one JSON line, appended, never deleted
├── sent.jsonl       every message sent, and every send that failed
├── done.jsonl       durable completion IDs, including messages handled without replying
├── queue.lock       short kernel lock for queue mutations (never delete lock files)
├── new/             messages nobody has taken yet, one file each
│   └── 1756808267-om_9f8e
├── cur/             taken but not yet replied; back to new/ after an hour
├── bad/             files that were in new/ but are not messages (a zero-byte file from a full disk); one log line each
├── log              the tool's own log: connected, reconnecting, send failed
└── listen.lock      held by the running listener (a kernel lock; the pid inside is for you)
```

Built-in receive, completion and stale recovery coordinate with the same short
kernel lock. The claim timestamp and rename cannot be separated by the sweep.
Completion is flushed to `done.jsonl` before queue removal, so a redelivery does
not resurrect a message whose consumer deliberately chose silence. This records
completion without pretending a reply was sent. Lock files stay in place; the
kernel releases ownership when a process exits.

Only files named `<arrival>-<id>` are the tool's. Anything else that lands in
`new/` (`.DS_Store`, an editor's swap file, a note) is left alone, never
claimed, never swept, never deleted.

The file in `new/` and the line in `received.jsonl` are the same bytes:

```json
{"id":"om_9f8e","chat":"oc_a1b2","thread":null,"sender":"on_7c6d",
 "sender_name":"Eric Fu","text":"@OpsAgent look at today's failed deploys",
 "kind":"text","quoted":null,"mentioned":true,"at":"2026-09-02T10:31:07Z"}
```

`sender_name` is who that id belongs to, empty when the platform has no name for
them. `sender` is still the key: a name is not unique and can change.

`quoted` carries the message a reply is answering — `{"id", "sender", "text",
"kind", "from_me"}` — and is `null` otherwise. `from_me` separates a reply to
the bot from a reply to somebody else in the same group, which are different
events; `mentioned` reads the same value.

`kind` says what arrived: `text` for anything readable as words, otherwise the
platform's own word for it — `image`, `sticker`, `audio` and the rest come
through with an empty `text`, and without `kind` they look exactly like a
message with nothing in it.

`chat` is where it came from; reply there and the answer lands beside the
question. `sender` is the person's `union_id`. `mentioned` is whether the bot
was @'d (always true in a direct message). Nothing else from Feishu is kept
unless you start `listen --raw`, so group titles and contact cards never reach
a prompt by accident.

You do not need the commands below to consume it:

```bash
ls ~/.co/inbox/feishu/new/                # how many are waiting
tail -f ~/.co/inbox/feishu/received.jsonl # watch live
grep on_7c6d ~/.co/inbox/feishu/received.jsonl | jq -r .text
co feishu receive --no-start -t 0       # claim with a fresh visibility timestamp
co feishu done MESSAGE_ID              # finish durably without sending a reply
```

The default directory follows `$AGENT_CONFIG_PATH`, normally `~/.co`.
A second set of applications gets its own root: `CO_INBOX_HOME=~/.co/inbox-ops co feishu listen`.
The variable moves the whole root rather than one channel, because moving one
and leaving the others only ever produced a half-configured machine.

## The verbs

```bash
co feishu listen                 # hold the connection, write the directory; Ctrl-C stops
co feishu receive                # block until a message arrives, take it, print it as one JSON line
co feishu receive -t 300         # give up after 5 minutes (exit 124, like timeout(1)); -t 0 looks once
co feishu send oc_a1b2 "all green"
echo "all green" | co feishu send oc_a1b2          # text from stdin, like mail
co feishu reply om_9f8e "fixed"                     # back to the chat and thread that message came from
co feishu done om_9f8e           # took it, decided not to answer; do not bring it back
co whatsapp edit om_9f8e "the corrected text"   # replace a message this account sent
co whatsapp delete om_9f8e       # delete a message for everyone
co feishu check                  # credentials, connectivity, listener, unread; exit 3 on a problem
co feishu ls                     # unread: id, chat, sender, text
co feishu log -f                 # the tool's log, following
co feishu listen --raw           # also keep Feishu's own payload on each received.jsonl line
co feishu receive --no-start     # wait for a message but never start a listener (a cron job, a test)
co feishu consume -- ./answer.sh   # the loop: receive, run the command, reply with its stdout
```

`receive` takes a message that is already queued without needing a listener;
when the queue is empty it starts a background `listen` if none is running, so
there is no daemon to remember. If that listener exits at once (no SDK,
credentials the platform refused), `receive` and `consume` print the reason from
the log and exit with the listener's own code: 3 when a person has to act, 1
otherwise. A listener that dies later, while `receive` waits, is noticed within
a second rather than at the end of the timeout. `listen` in the foreground is for watching it work and
for a service manager; one listener per directory. A second `listen` on the
same directory says `already listening (pid N)` and exits 1.

Exit codes, the same on every verb:

| exit | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | done | |
| 1 | the platform or the listener refused; its own sentence is on stderr | read it; `log` has the same line |
| 2 | usage: unknown flag, nothing to send | `co feishu <verb> --help` |
| 3 | not configured: a credential, the SDK, or the bot capability is missing | `check` names the item |
| 124 | `receive -t N` saw nothing in N seconds | the same as `timeout(1)` |

`listen` never prints a traceback. When Feishu refuses the credentials it
writes one line (`Feishu refused the credentials: 10003 invalid param`),
points at `log`, releases the lock and exits 1, without dialling the long
connection: a pair Feishu has just rejected cannot connect, and the SDK's
own retry would otherwise hide the refusal behind `connect failed` lines
every two minutes.

`reply ID` needs only the id: chat and thread are read from `received.jsonl`. It
refuses to answer the same message twice unless you pass `--again`, so a loop
that re-runs cannot double-post. A taken message that is neither replied to
nor marked `done` comes back to `new/` after an hour, on the assumption that
its consumer died; `done` is how a consumer says it chose silence. `done`
refuses an id this inbox never received (exit 1, `Next: co feishu ls`): the id
would otherwise be recorded as finished, and the real message with that id
dropped the day it arrived. `send` and `reply` print the id Feishu gave
the new message and exit 1 with Feishu's own reason if it was refused.

### Changing a message after it has gone out

`edit` replaces the text of a message this account sent; `delete` removes one
for everyone. Both take the id `send` or `reply` printed.

```bash
ID=$(co whatsapp send 61400000000@s.whatsapp.net "deploy finished at **14:02**")
co whatsapp edit "$ID" "deploy finished at **14:20**"
co whatsapp delete "$ID"
```

WhatsApp stamps an edit as coming from you and checks it, so **only your own
messages can be edited** — asking to edit a message you received says so
rather than reporting a bad id. `delete` also covers somebody else's message
when this account is an admin of that group; WhatsApp decides that and gives
its own reason when it refuses.

**WhatsApp only, for now.** `co feishu edit` and `co lark edit` print the
endpoints that exist for it (`PUT` and `DELETE` on `/im/v1/messages/<id>`) and
say nobody has wired them up, so a missing feature never reads as a bad id.

### Markdown, not plain text

`send`, `reply` and `edit` read their text as Markdown and translate it into
WhatsApp's own marks, because the thing writing the text is usually a model and
a model writes Markdown. Untranslated, `**ready**` arrives with the asterisks
still on it.

| you write | it arrives as |
|---|---|
| `**ready**` | *ready* in bold |
| `*maybe*` | _maybe_ in italic |
| `~~dropped~~` | ~dropped~ struck through |
| `# Deploy failed` | *Deploy failed* in bold |
| `- one` | • one |
| `[the run](https://…)` | the run: https://… |

Nothing inside a fenced block or `` `backticks` `` is converted. `--plain`
sends the characters exactly as typed. Feishu's `text` message has no inline
formatting to translate into, so it accepts `--plain` and changes nothing;
rich text there is a different message type.

## Your own agent, no flags

Say which channels the agent answers in `~/.co/host.yaml`, beside the name and
the trust level it already keeps there:

```yaml
name: oo
trust: open
listen:
  feishu:
    chats: [oc_a1b2]      # absent or empty = every group the bot is in
    mention_only: true    # a group needs an @; a direct message is already one
  lark: {}
```

Then start it the way you always did:

```bash
co ai                     # answers the channels in the file
co server                 # so does a deployed Host
```

The command line is for overriding that file for one run, not for configuring
it: `co ai --listen lark` answers only Lark this time, `co ai --no-listen`
answers nothing. A channel named on the command line still takes its options
from the file. An unknown channel, or a `host.yaml` that does not parse, stops
the start and says which — an agent nobody can reach otherwise looks exactly
like a working one.

Each conversation keeps its own session, so a follow-up remembers the question
it follows, and two threads of one group do not read as non-sequiturs to each
other. One chat never sees another's messages: a new chat starts from the
system prompt, not from whichever chat spoke last. On a Host the turn is recorded in `.co/session_results.jsonl` beside the
interactive ones, carrying `via: feishu` and the sender.

In 1.8.5 anyone who can address the bot can command it. A self-built
application is scoped to your tenant and to the groups the bot was invited to,
so that is your company, not the internet. Sender allowlists arrive in 1.9.

Both watch the listener they depend on, the way `receive` does. One that dies
is restarted. One that exits 3 (a missing SDK, a token the platform refused)
is reported once with its reason, `feishu: the listener exited 3: …`, and that
channel stops being answered until you fix it and restart; the web UI, other
channels and the Host itself carry on. One that exits any other way and will
not restart is reported once and tried again every minute, and messages already
queued are still answered meanwhile.

## Any other agent, two lines

```bash
m=$(co feishu receive)                       # {"id":"om_9f8e","chat":"oc_a1b2","text":"...",...}
echo "done, all green" | co feishu reply om_9f8e
```

Or let the tool run the loop for you:

```bash
co feishu consume -- claude -p                 # one claude per message; its stdout is the reply
co feishu consume -- codex exec -
co feishu consume -- ./answer.sh
```

`consume` runs the command with the message JSON on stdin and these variables:
`CO_PROVIDER`, `CO_CHAT`, `CO_THREAD`, `CO_SENDER`, `CO_MSG_ID`, and
`CO_CHAT_DIR` (a per-chat directory the command may keep its own state in).
Non-empty stdout is sent back as the reply and the message is done. Empty
stdout with exit 0 is the command choosing silence: also done, noted in
`log`. A non-zero exit, or a reply Feishu refused, sends nothing, is reported
on stderr with the message id while the loop carries on, and leaves the
message taken: it comes back to `new/` in an hour, the same as a
consumer that died, so a transient failure is retried and a question is
never silently consumed. A command that cannot be run at all (`./answer.sh`
without its exec bit) is refused with exit 2 before any message is taken.

`consume` was called `serve` in 1.8.5b1 and the old name is gone, not aliased —
this project does not ship hidden commands, and `serve` was public for a few
hours in one opt-in beta. It was renamed because nothing here serves
anything — it takes messages off a queue and hands each to a command, which is
what this design calls a consumer throughout, and what `lark-cli event consume`
calls it too. A verb another agent can guess is worth more than one it has to
be told.

`consume` runs one command at a time, because commands written for it have
always run alone and some are not safe to run twice at once. `--workers N`
answers N conversations at once; messages within one conversation stay in
order whatever N is.

While a command is running, `consume` keeps saying so, so the hour is measured
from the last sign of life rather than from when the message was taken. A
command that takes ninety minutes is not interrupted; one whose process died
is offered to the next consumer as before. A message that has been handed out
four times without ever finishing is completed with a `gave up` line in the
log: something about that one breaks whoever takes it, and handing it out
again just breaks the next consumer too, every hour, forever.

## What the tool does for you

- Acknowledges Feishu within its three-second window by doing nothing in the
  handler but writing the two files; the agent runs elsewhere.
- Writes the log line and the queue file before acknowledging, so a crash
  after the acknowledgement loses nothing.
- Drops redelivered messages by id, against the log, so a duplicate is dropped
  after a restart too.
- Returns a taken-but-unanswered message to `new/` after an hour, so a
  consumer that died mid-task does not make it vanish.
- Reconnects on its own and writes each attempt to `log`.
- Retries a rate-limited send three times with backoff. Feishu allows five
  messages per second per group, shared with every bot in that group.
- Fetches a new tenant token when Feishu says the cached one is no longer
  good, so rotating the app secret in the console does not leave `consume`
  failing every reply until the old token's two hours are up.
- Keeps one listener per directory with a lock the kernel holds: a listener
  killed with SIGKILL, or a reboot, holds nothing, so the next `receive`
  starts a fresh one instead of waiting on a pid that is gone.
- Treats a redelivery as the recovery it is. If the log line was written but
  the queue file was not (a crash between the two), the redelivered message
  is queued, not dropped as a duplicate; only a message that is queued,
  taken or answered is a duplicate.
- Makes `reply --again` a real second post. Feishu holds a reply key to one
  post per hour; a retry of the same text reuses it and is dropped, `--again`
  uses a fresh key and lands.

## The free edition's API quota

Feishu's free edition (基础免费版) caps **all self-built apps in a tenant,
together, at 10,000 counted API calls a month** since November 2024, and
refuses counted calls for the rest of the month once it is spent (error
`99991403`). Paid editions lift it. Feishu raised the free cap to 1,000,000
in June 2026 as a limited-time change; the admin console (管理后台 > 费用中心
> 权益数据) shows the number that applies to you today.

What this tool spends, per Feishu's own list of what counts:

| call | counted? | when |
|---|---|---|
| receiving a message over the long connection | no (event subscription) | every message |
| `tenant_access_token` | no (authentication) | every process, at most once |
| `bot/v3/info` | yes | once per `listen` start and per `check` |
| `messages/{id}/reply`, `messages` (send) | yes | once per `reply` or `send` |

So 10,000 a month is 10,000 replies, and listening costs nothing. Do not poll
`check` on a timer: a bot that probed itself every minute is how others burnt
the whole month in a week.

## Lark

`co lark` is the same tool with three differences: the domain is
`open.larksuite.com`, the credentials are `LARK_APP_ID` and `LARK_APP_SECRET`,
and the directory is `~/.co/inbox/lark/`. Every verb, flag,
file and exit code above is identical. A tenant on Feishu and a tenant on Lark
are two applications with two directories; nothing is shared between them.
Error messages name the platform you are talking to, so a `co lark` user is
never sent to the Feishu console.

## Keeping it running

`receive`, `consume`, `co ai` and a Host restart a listener that died, so a consumer loop is
enough for most setups. To hold the connection whether or not anything is
consuming, run `listen` under the service manager you already have. On macOS:

```xml
<!-- ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openonion.co-feishu-listen.plist -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0"><dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>ai.openonion.co-feishu-listen</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key><array><string>/usr/local/bin/co</string><string>feishu</string><string>listen</string></array>
  <key>KeepAlive</key><true/>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string>/tmp/co-feishu-listen.err</string>
</dict></plist>
```

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openonion.co-feishu-listen.plist
```

On Linux the equivalent is a `systemd --user` unit with `Restart=always`.
Either way the process reads `~/.co/keys.env` itself, so the unit carries no
secrets. The listener writes nothing to stdout; its life is in `log`.

## What it does not do

It does not decide who may command an agent. Feishu's `group_at_msg` scope
already limits what reaches the bot to messages that @ it; anything finer,
such as an allowlist of senders, belongs to whatever consumes the directory.
It does not carry images, files or cards (a non-text message arrives as its
type in brackets, `[image]`), and it does not stream partial replies.

Messages are plain text on disk in a directory only you can read. The log
grows; rotate it with `logrotate` like any other.

## 1.8.5 integration acceptance

The implementation is being integrated on top of stable 1.8.4. Synthetic tests
cover durable completion after silence, redelivery after a partial write, torn
JSONL tails, unsafe ID collisions, and a stale sweep racing the claim timestamp.
An unread malformed file is quarantined by both receive and ls; valid messages
remain available. Queue/log writes are flushed before delivery returns.

Real channel delivery and provider behavior during a network gap remain separate
acceptance gates. Local concurrency tests do not establish that Feishu retains
events throughout an arbitrarily long disconnection. No existing listener or
polling automation should be stopped merely to run a synthetic test.

## Recovering a disconnected listener

The candidate reconciles history on startup and after an SDK reconnect. It uses
only conversations already recorded in this inbox; it does not discover or
import every chat the bot can access. The first run starts a new history boundary
at the listener's start time. Preserve `recovery.json` with the inbox when
restarting: deleting it discards that recovery boundary.

Every history page passes through the same message-ID deduplication and durable
completion records as WebSocket events. A successful pass advances the checkpoint;
a failed page, denied permission, or storage failure leaves it unchanged and is
retried after 60 seconds. `co lark check` reports an outstanding recovery failure.
This work runs outside the WebSocket callback so fetching history does not delay
live-event acknowledgements.

Recovery needs the bot scope **`im:message.group_msg`** and access to each known
conversation. Without it every pass fails with `230027 … need scope:
im:message.group_msg`, the checkpoint is held rather than advanced, and
`co <provider> check` prints a link that grants it — one click, no Developer
Console. An application created by `co auth` asks for it up front.

Group recovery admits only messages that mention this bot;
it does not turn unrelated group discussion into agent work. Known direct chats
retain their direct-message semantics. Known threads and threads discovered in
history are paginated separately. Messages in conversations the inbox has never
seen, deleted messages, and history the provider no longer exposes cannot be
promised recoverable. These limits also apply to `co feishu`.

Measured on a live Lark tenant, 15 September 2026: listener killed, a message
posted during a 90-second gap, listener restarted — `history recovery complete:
1 new message(s)`, the message queued exactly once, and no WebSocket `received`
line for it, so recovery is what delivered it rather than platform redelivery.
The 8 September loss that opened this gate is explained by the missing scope
above, which no setup route granted at the time. See
[the run](../acceptance/1.8.5/lark-live-2026-09-15.md).

Not claimed: that run reproduced a killed listener and a frozen one, not a
transport aborted with its reconnects rejected. What it shows is that when the
platform does not redeliver, recovery does.
