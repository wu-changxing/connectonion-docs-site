# ConnectOnion Email (co email)

Every agent gets its own email address. `co email` lets you send and read from
it right in the terminal — no separate mail client, no Gmail OAuth.

Your address is derived from your agent's identity, e.g.
`0x7a9f3b2c@mail.openonion.ai`. It's activated by `co auth`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check your inbox (the zero-arg default)
co email

# Send a message
co email send alice@example.com "Hello" "Thanks for trying ConnectOnion!"

# Read message #42 from the inbox list
co email read 42
co email read 42 --mark-read      # opt in to changing mailbox state
```

That's the whole surface. Everything below is detail.

## Commands

### `co email` — Show the inbox

With no subcommand, prints your most recent emails. Same as `co email inbox`.

```bash
co email
```

### `co email inbox` — List received email

```bash
co email inbox                 # last 10
co email inbox --last 25       # last 25  (alias: -n 25)
co email inbox --last 1000     # largest received-mail page
co email inbox -n 1000 --offset 1000  # next page of older mail
co email inbox --unread        # only unread  (alias: -u)
```

Unread messages are marked with a green `●`. The leftmost `#` is the email's
id — pass it to `co email read`.

**Options**
- `--last, -n` — how many to show (default: 10, range: 1–1000)
- `--offset` — how many newer emails to skip (default: 0)
- `--unread, -u` — only unread messages

> Note: `--unread` filters the fetched page locally, so `--last 10 --unread`
> means "unread among your 10 most recent," not "your 10 most recent unread."

Each received-mail page can contain up to 1000 messages. Continue through a
larger inbox with offsets 0, 1000, 2000, and so on until a page is empty. Page
sizes outside 1–1000 and negative offsets fail locally instead of becoming a
generic backend validation error.

### `co email read <#>` — Read one message

```bash
co email read 42
co email read 42 --mark-read
```

Prints the sender, subject, date, and body without changing unread state. Add
`--mark-read` only after you intend to consume the message.

> Reads from your 1000 most recent messages. An email older than that won't be
> found by id yet (see [Limitations](#limitations)).

### `co email send <to> <subject> <message>` — Send

```bash
co email send bob@example.com "Subject line" "Body text"
```

Every send carries a request ID and an idempotency key. If the result is
uncertain (for example, a timeout after the provider accepted the message),
the failure prints the key. Reuse it to retry without sending a duplicate:

```bash
co email send bob@example.com "Subject line" "Body text" \
  --idempotency-key 4f07d5b4-9d8e-4e58-a889-11bb14cc70ab
```

The same key must only be reused with the same recipient, subject, and body.

All three arguments are positional and required. The message body is sent as
provided; HTML markup is supported, and ordinary text can be passed directly.

```bash
# Plain text
co email send bob@example.com "Hi" "Just checking in."

# HTML
co email send bob@example.com "Receipt" "<h1>Paid</h1><p>Thanks!</p>"
```

### `co email sent` — List sent email

```bash
co email sent                        # last 10
co email sent --last 25              # last 25  (alias: -n 25)
co email sent --to alice@example.com # only mail sent to alice
```

What your agent has sent, newest first, with each message's last known status.
The leftmost `#` is the email's id — pass it to `co email sent read`. Useful
after a failed batch: if a send is listed here, the server accepted it, and
retrying would produce a duplicate.

Options:
- `--last, -n` — how many to show (default 10)
- `--to` — only messages sent to this address

### `co email sent read <#>` — Read one sent message

```bash
co email sent read 7
```

Prints the recipient, sender address, status, provider message id, date, and
the body that was actually sent.

## Customizing your address (paid)

The two commands below spend ConnectOnion credits. Each shows you the price or
new quota first, then applies it — nothing is charged unless you opt in.

### `co email name <name>` — Claim a readable address

By default your address is derived from your agent's key
(`0x7a9f3b2c@mail.openonion.ai`). Claim a human-readable one instead:

```bash
co email name aaron          # check if aaron@openonion.ai is free + its price
co email name aaron --buy    # claim it (one-time charge from your credits)
```

Without `--buy` it only **checks availability** and prints the one-time price
(returned live by the backend, so it's always current). Add `--buy` to claim
it — the price is deducted from your credit balance and the name becomes your
sending address.

```bash
$ co email name aaron
✓ aaron@openonion.ai is available — $5.00 one-time, from credits
Claim it: co email name aaron --buy

$ co email name aaron --buy
✓ Claimed aaron@openonion.ai
  Your address: aaron@openonion.ai
```

> Prices here are illustrative — the real figure is whatever the check command
> prints. If the name is taken you'll see why (`✗ … — unavailable`).

### `co email upgrade <tier>` — Raise your sending quota

The paid tiers (`plus`, `pro`) lift the monthly quota and are billed from your
credits. An existing `@mail.openonion.ai` mailbox can keep its exact address;
otherwise select the domain and alias offered by the tier:

```bash
co email upgrade plus --keep-address                          # keep the current hosted address
co email upgrade plus --domain steadmail.com --alias support  # plus, new hosted address
co email upgrade pro  --domain mail.acme.com --alias support  # pro + a mailbox alias
```

**Options**
- `--keep-address` — preserve the current `@mail.openonion.ai` address (plus only)
- `--domain, -d` — sending domain (required unless `--keep-address` is used)
- `--alias, -a` — mailbox alias, e.g. `support` → `support@mail.acme.com`

Leave out both the domain and `--keep-address` and the upgrade is rejected
before anything is charged:

```bash
$ co email upgrade plus
✗ Domain required for plus tier
```

On success the server returns your new address, monthly quota, and remaining
balance — values that reflect your account, not fixed doc numbers.

## Setup

Email requires authentication once:

```bash
co auth
```

This saves `OPENONION_API_KEY` and sets `AGENT_EMAIL` / `IS_EMAIL_ACTIVE=true`.
If you run an email command before authenticating you'll get a prompt to run
`co auth` first.

## Same functions, in your agent

The CLI is a thin wrapper over two tool functions you can hand to any agent:

```python
from connectonion import Agent
from connectonion.useful_tools import send_email, get_emails

agent = Agent("mailer", tools=[send_email, get_emails])
agent.input("Check my inbox and reply to anything urgent.")
```

So anything `co email` does, your agent can do too. See
[send_email](../useful_tools/send_email.md) and
[get_emails](../useful_tools/get_emails.md).

## Limitations

- **`read` only sees your recent 100 messages.** The backend has no
  single-email endpoint yet, so `read` lists and filters by id client-side.
- **No `reply` yet.** To reply, copy the sender into `send`:
  `co email send <their-address> "Re: ..." "..."`.
- **Long / multi-line bodies** are awkward as a shell argument. For now, quote
  carefully; piping a body from a file is not wired up.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No API key found"** → run `co auth`.
- **"AGENT_EMAIL not found"** → run `co auth` to activate email.
- **Authentication failed (401)** → token expired, re-run `co auth`.
- **Rate limit exceeded (429)** → you've hit your tier's send quota; check
  `co status`.
