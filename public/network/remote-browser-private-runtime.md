# Remote Browser private runtime

Remote Browser lifecycle uses the existing `BrowserDaemon` and
`AsyncBrowserCore`, but it does not attach to the ordinary local `co browser`
instance. The Host derives a private target from its durable Remote Browser
state path and starts the same daemon implementation with explicit authority.

This is delivery step 3 of
[DD-056](../design-decisions/056-remote-browser-egress-gateway.md). It isolates
the runtime and wires the loopback gateway into Chromium's requested launch
configuration. It does **not** expose navigation or claim that Chromium's
effective network behavior has passed the native bypass vectors required by
step 4.

## Isolation contract

Each Host state file deterministically selects one private runtime with its own:

- native Unix socket or Windows named-pipe namespace;
- lifetime PID and singleton-lock sidecars;
- persistent browser profile;
- daemon log;
- Windows IPC authentication key;
- ephemeral authenticated egress gateway credential; and
- an optional mode-`0600` Laptop Proxy selection read only at runtime start.

The local `co browser` namespace and profile remain unchanged. Local and private
daemons can run at the same time and stop independently. Long project paths are
hashed into short endpoint names so Darwin's `AF_UNIX` limit cannot collapse
the isolation contract into a launch failure.

The private runtime directory is mode `0700` on POSIX. The Windows auth key is
created through the existing atomic, per-file HMAC-key path. Gateway passwords
are never command-line arguments and are excluded from dataclass
representations. The session registry, state file, log path, errors, and command
results contain no proxy credential.

`RemoteBrowserService`, not BrowserDaemon, selects `direct` or `shared` and
writes the private selection before asking the daemon adapter to open a tab.
BrowserDaemon consumes that immutable choice while constructing the WTF Browser
launch policy; it cannot select another Proxy or fall back to Direct. The
Laptop's `co proxy` process has its own lifecycle and remains independently
stoppable if BrowserDaemon fails.

## Start and stop order

```text
start gateway -> build immutable launch policy -> build browser -> bind IPC

stop admission -> close browser -> stop gateway -> remove owned IPC state
```

If the gateway cannot start or the browser cannot be constructed, the daemon
never binds its IPC endpoint. If the gateway stops serving later, every daemon
command returns `EGRESS_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE` before a tab or browser mutation.
There is no Direct fallback.

For shared egress the loopback gateway replaces its system resolver and numeric
dialer together: DNS asks the Laptop Proxy for its complete classified answer
set, and the selected numeric connection returns to that same Laptop Proxy.
Chromium and the remote operating system never resolve the destination. The
Laptop Proxy is reached through the channel the Laptop itself attached with
`co proxy share` — a second loopback gateway in the host process, keyed by the
Laptop's address — so the host never dials the Laptop.

## Requested Chromium launch policy

The daemon passes one immutable policy directly to `AsyncBrowserCore`; private
launch does not consult `BROWSER_PROXY` or `CO_BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR`. The policy
requests:

- the authenticated gateway at exactly `http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-port>`;
- Chromium's subtractive `<-loopback>` proxy-bypass rule;
- `MAP * ~NOTFOUND, EXCLUDE 127.0.0.1` host-resolver rules;
- QUIC disabled;
- non-proxied WebRTC UDP disabled;
- extensions disabled;
- Service Workers requested blocked; and
- a dedicated persistent profile with downloads accepted.

Each switch above is present in the launched binary. That is not a formality:
`--force-webrtc-ip-handling-policy` — the spelling this policy carried until it
was checked against Chrome 151 — appears nowhere in that binary, and Chromium
ignores an unknown switch in silence, so a page kept full non-proxied UDP while
the configuration read as enforced. `BrowserLaunchPolicy` now refuses to
construct without each of the four egress switches, so the invariant belongs to
the type rather than to one module's tuple.

**The Service Worker request is not effective on the shipped driver.** Measured
against real Chrome with these options, `service_workers="block"` registers,
activates and controls a page exactly as `"allow"` does; the bundled driver
gates only its own network inspection on that value. Worker traffic still goes
through the gateway, which remains the final authority, so this widens no
egress — but it is a requested control that does not hold, tracked separately
rather than described here as a guarantee.

The proxy value rejects non-loopback hosts, alternate spellings, paths,
userinfo, query strings, fragments, empty credentials, and fallback proxy
lists. These tests prove the configuration requested from Playwright. They do
not prove that a pinned Chromium build honored every switch or that every
request class used the proxy; those are the native zero-socket assertions in
the next delivery step.

## Verification and rollback

The focused matrix runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with Python 3.10–3.13. It
checks namespace separation, secret-safe launch values, gateway-before-bind and
browser-before-gateway ordering, fail-closed gateway loss, environment
independence, concurrent local/private native daemons, and signed OIP lifecycle
reconnection through the private target.

Rollback removes the private target selection and daemon launch mode together.
Remote Browser then returns to lifecycle-only operation with navigation still
unavailable. Rollback must never point Remote Browser at the ordinary local
daemon or remove the gateway while leaving page commands enabled.
