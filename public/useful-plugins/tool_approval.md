# tool_approval

Canonical OIP permission modes plus WebSocket approval for calls that need a
human decision.

## Modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `read-only` | Manual approval for every effectful live-IO call not explicitly permitted |
| `auto` | Runs ordinary local commands; asks or denies the ones that leave the machine, execute unreadable input, touch credentials, or write outside the workspace |
| `full-access` | Explicit bounded approval bypass under the Host launch ceiling |

No aliases are accepted or translated. Unknown stored values become Auto.
Todo List progress never grants a permission mode; Plan is not a mode.

## Quick Start

```python
from connectonion import Agent, bash
from connectonion.useful_plugins import tool_approval

agent = Agent("assistant", tools=[bash], plugins=[tool_approval])
agent.io = my_websocket_io  # Required for web mode

agent.input("Install dependencies")
# → Client receives: {"type": "approval_needed", "tool": "bash", "arguments": {"command": "npm install"}}
# → Client responds: {"approved": true, "scope": "session"}
# ✓ bash approved (session)
```

## Lifecycle

This example applies to every authenticated participant. Administrative
control-plane authorization is separate from an ordinary session mode.

```
User sends prompt
    ↓
Agent calls LLM
    ↓
LLM returns tool_calls batch: [bash("npm install"), write("config.json"), bash("npm build")]
    ↓
tool_executor iterates sequentially:
    ↓
┌─ Tool #1: bash("npm install")
│   before_each_tool fires → deterministic policy → check_approval()
│   → Policy result: ask (package installation is not focused verification)
│   → Already approved for session? No
│   → Send to client:
│       {
│         "type": "approval_needed",
│         "tool": "bash",
│         "arguments": {"command": "npm install"},
│         "batch_remaining": [
│           {"tool": "write", "arguments": "{...}"},
│           {"tool": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"npm build\"}"}
│         ]
│       }
│   → BLOCK — wait for client response
│   ↓
│   Client responds: {"approved": true, "scope": "session"}
│   → Execute bash("npm install")
│   → Save "bash" as session-approved
│
├─ Tool #2: write("config.json")
│   before_each_tool fires → check_approval()
│   → Explicitly permitted? No
│   → Send approval_needed (batch_remaining: [bash(...)])
│   → Client responds: {"approved": false, "mode": "reject_soft"}
│   → Skip this tool, continue to next
│
├─ Tool #3: bash("npm build")
│   before_each_tool fires → check_approval()
│   → bash is session-approved → skip approval, execute immediately
│
└─ Done. Return results to LLM.
```

## Rejection Modes

When the client rejects a tool, the `mode` field determines what happens next:

### reject_soft (Skip)

Skip this tool, agent loop continues. The LLM receives a hint to ask the user what they prefer.

```json
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_soft", "feedback": "Don't write that file"}
```

- Current tool is skipped (raises ValueError)
- Next tool in the batch proceeds normally
- LLM gets: `"User rejected tool 'write'. Feedback: Don't write that file\n\n[System reminder: Ask the user...]"`

### reject_hard (Stop)

Skip this tool AND all remaining tools in the batch. The agent loop stops and waits for new user input.

```json
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_hard", "feedback": "Wrong approach entirely"}
```

- Current tool is skipped (raises ValueError)
- `stop_signal` flag is set in session
- All remaining tools in the batch are auto-rejected
- Agent loop stops — LLM does NOT get another turn
- User must send a new message to continue

Default mode when `mode` is not provided: `reject_hard`.

## Batch Context

When a tool needs approval, the server includes `batch_remaining` — a list of tools that will execute after the current one. This gives the client an overview to make informed decisions.

```json
{
  "type": "approval_needed",
  "tool": "bash",
  "arguments": {"command": "npm install"},
  "batch_remaining": [
    {"tool": "write", "arguments": "{\"file_path\": \"config.json\", ...}"},
    {"tool": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"npm build\"}"}
  ]
}
```

`batch_remaining` is only present when there are more tools after the current one. For the last tool in a batch (or a single-tool call), it is omitted.

## Tool Classification

### Template-Permitted Tools (No Approval)

The standard host template grants explicit permissions to its built-in read-only tools:

```
read, read_file, glob, grep, search
list_files, get_file_info, task, load_guide
task_output, ask_user
```

### Known Effectful Tools (Require Approval Unless Permitted)

Operations that can modify files or have side effects:

```
bash, shell, run, run_in_dir
write, edit, multi_edit
run_background, kill_task
send_email, post, delete, remove
```

### Focused Verification (Auto)

Test, lint, type-check and build commands run without a dialog. This category
is an execution surface by design — an agent that may write a test and run it
may run whatever that test runs — so what the narrowing does is keep out the
commands in it that are not verification at all. `cargo` is limited to
`test`/`check`/`clippy`/`build`, `go` to `test`, the package runners to
targets naming test/lint/build/check/typecheck, and `make` to a named
verification target with no `-C`/`-f` redirecting it elsewhere: `make test`
runs, `make install`, bare `make` and `make -C /etc all` ask.

### Read-Only Commands (Auto)

In Auto, a shell command whose every segment only reads, filters or prints
runs without a dialog — and, unattended, without being denied:

```
head tail cat less more grep egrep fgrep rg wc ls sort uniq cut tr
basename dirname jq echo printf pwd cd true test [ which file stat diff
date whoami hostname uname
```

`sed` and `awk` are deliberately **not** on it. They take a program, and a
program is code: `awk 'BEGIN{system("rm -rf /")}'` reads like an inspection
and is arbitrary execution, and GNU `sed`'s `e` flag is the same. A rule that
kept them while excluding their execution constructs would be a parser in a
security path. Both ask, as they did before 1.8.5, including their innocent
shapes — whose job `head`, `tail`, `cut` and `read_file(limit=, offset=)`
already do. Nothing else on the list takes a program text.

Two things take a listed command back out. A path argument that resolves
outside the workspace (`cat /etc/hosts`, `head ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `cd ..`) asks,
the same way the read *tools* ask for outside-workspace reads. And a file
argument the policy cannot resolve asks: `cat $(cat which_file.txt)` reads
whatever that file names and `head $HOME/x` whatever `HOME` is, so neither is
a checked read. A bare `$` is end-of-line, not a variable, so
`grep 'foo$' notes.txt` is unaffected.

Credentials are denied before any of this applies, and not only by token
(`.env`, `secret`, `credential`): key material is recognised by where it lives
and what it is called — anything under `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.azure`,
`.kube`, `.docker` or a `keys` directory (which includes the agent's own
`.co/keys/`), the usual filenames (`id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `authorized_keys`,
`.npmrc`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.pypirc`, `keys.env`), and the usual
suffixes (`.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`, `.pfx`, `.jks`, `.keystore`, `.ppk`). A read
of key material is a credential read wherever it sits, so this does not depend
on the workspace rule — the workspace is sometimes the home directory, keys
get committed, and `.co/keys/` is under the project root. Matching is on path
components and suffixes, so `keys.md` and `monkey.txt` are ordinary files.

The read, write, edit and delete *tools* hold the same line: `read_file`,
`glob`, `write`, `edit` and the rest refuse key material by the same rule.
They have to — a gate one tool wide is a detour, and a model asked for
`cat server.pem` will simply reach for `read_file` instead.

An output redirect (`> out`, `>> log`, `2> err`) is a file write and is held
to the write tool's rules: inside the workspace it is a reversible edit and
allowed (`echo x > notes.txt`, `cat << 'EOF' > src/main.rs ... EOF` — models
reach for both instead of the write tool); a control file is denied; a target
outside the workspace is denied; a target that depends on the environment
(`> $HOME/x`) cannot be resolved and asks. `2>&1` is not a write. A heredoc
is classified by its first line — the body is data to that command — so
`bash << EOF` still asks, because `bash` runs whatever the body says.

### A command runs unless a rule holds it back

A command nobody thought of runs. There is no list of safe command names to be
on, because that list can never be finished — an unattended job dies on the
first tool nobody added, which is how a seven-times-a-day round died at
iteration sixteen on `head -40` (#1481).

What holds a command back, all checked before the default applies:

| rule | example | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| destroys files | `rm -rf build`, `shred x` | deny |
| credentials or key material | `env`, `aws s3 ls`, `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` | deny |
| writes outside the workspace | `echo x > ../out`, `cp f /etc/x` | deny |
| rewrites an authorization control file | `> .co/host.yaml` | deny |
| leaves the machine | `curl`, `ssh`, `git push`, `co email send`, `co feishu send` | ask |
| runs a program this policy cannot read | `bash << EOF`, `python3 -c`, `awk`, `sed`, `uv run python -c` | ask |
| deletes or executes through a flag | `find . -delete`, `find . -exec` | ask |
| reads outside the workspace | `cat /etc/passwd` | ask |
| cannot be parsed | `echo 'unclosed` | ask |

A chain is only as permitted as its worst link: `ls && rm -rf build` is denied.
`co browser status && co email send ...` is still an email send nobody
authorized, so it asks, and in an unattended run that is a refusal.

One known gap, recorded rather than guessed at: `gh pr create` is allowed.
`create` is too generic to add to the outward list — `co create my-agent` is
local work — and a pull request is a reversible proposal in the operator's own
repository.

This is the Auto policy for the agent's own calls. The remote-EXEC whitelist
in `host.yaml` is a separate gate and is not widened by it.

### Planning tools

A class whose every method is planning with no side effect is recognised by
what owns the call, not by its name. `TodoList` registers `add`, `start`,
`complete`, `update`, `list`, `remove` and `clear`; matching those names would
be wrong in both directions, since `remove` is a deletion and `list` is a read
for every other tool. Before this, `todo_list` sat in the workflow list and was
never a tool name, so 438 `add` calls were refused in six days (#1447).

### Unknown Tools

Unknown and dynamically registered tools are never silently allowed. In Auto,
they ask through the existing approval protocol; without an approval channel,
they fail closed. Auto applies whenever the canonical session mode is `auto`.
Authenticated participants can answer their own approval requests and use the
same Host-advertised modes.

## Config-Based Auto-Approval

Auto-approve safe commands permanently via `host.yaml` configuration. Config permissions never expire and apply to all sessions.

### An explicit grant is an approval already given

A grant somebody wrote down on purpose runs the call, with or without a person
present, for any effect class:

| source | who wrote it | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | the operator, in `.co/host.yaml` — a control file the agent may not write | until removed |
| `skill` | a skill author, in its `tools:` frontmatter | that turn |
| `user` | a human answering a dialog | that session |
| `template` | nobody; it ships with the product | ordinary commands only |

So `Bash(curl *)` in your own `host.yaml` fetches URLs unattended and stops
asking you every time, `Bash(rm -rf build)` cleans your build directory, and a
skill that declares `Bash(mkdir *)` can make directories. Before 1.8.5 none of
those worked: an explicit grant was discarded for every effect class except an
unclassified command, so eight of nine hand-written grants were ignored and a
skill's declaration bought nothing at all (#1481).

Two things still cannot happen.

**A wildcard is honoured only for the effect its own text names.**
`Bash(curl *)` classifies as external network and so does the command it
matches, so the operator plainly meant network access. `Bash(git *)` is an
ordinary command while `git push origin main` publishes, so the wildcard does
not carry it — `Bash(git push *)` does. An exact pattern always names its own
effect.

**The shipped defaults are not your grant.** The template's 78 `Bash(...)`
entries load as `source: template` and buy only what they always did. The
broad `Bash(co *)` reaches `co status` and `co browser ...`, and nothing else:
`co` is a multiplexer, and its strong verbs are classified by verb — `co email
send` is an external effect, `co transfer` a payment, `co keys` a credential —
so a wildcard over `co` cannot reach them however it is written.

A third-party skill installed with `co copy` can declare whatever `tools:` it
likes, and those grants are honoured. That is the same trust you extend by
installing it; read a skill's frontmatter before you install it.

### Every refusal says why, how, and think again

A refused call comes back with a `<system-reminder>` in three parts. The
human-rejection paths in this plugin have carried guidance like this for a
long time; the policy's own refusals did not, and an agent reading "command is
outside the focused verification allowlist" has nothing to do with it but try
again — which is guaranteed to fail, because the decision is deterministic. A
scheduled job drained its iteration budget that way and ended with nothing
done.

```
<system-reminder>
REFUSED: bash — reading outside the workspace requires approval; …

WHY
This was refused because the file is outside this workspace, or its path comes
from a variable or a substitution so the policy cannot tell where it points.
The decision is deterministic: the identical call will be refused again,
every time.

HOW TO ALLOW IT NEXT TIME
  • in .co/host.yaml: "Bash(cat /etc/hosts)" …
  • or in the skill that needs it: tools: ["Bash(cat /etc/hosts)"]

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE — re-think, do not repeat
1. What were you actually trying to achieve? Name the goal, not the command.
2. Read something inside the workspace, or spell the path out literally. …
3. If you cannot get there without this exact call, stop and tell the user
   the line above and what it is for. That is a useful answer; a retry loop
   is not.
Do not retry this call, and do not reach for a different spelling of it.
</system-reminder>
```

Part 2 is per effect class and says what to try *instead* — for a credential,
that you almost never need a secret's contents; for a `sed`/`awk` refusal, that
`head`, `cut` and `read_file(limit=, offset=)` do the reading job without a
grant; for a publication, that preparing the change and stopping is the answer.

**The suggested grant is checked against the grant path before it is printed.**
Some refusals cannot be lifted by any pattern — a control file, or a redirect
outside the workspace, because the parser strips redirects out of the text a
pattern is matched against. Those say `THERE IS NO GRANT FOR THIS` rather than
naming a line that would not work. A remedy that does not work is worse than
none: it gets widened until something does.

### The grant line itself

Without a grant, an unattended refusal used to name a policy — "command is
outside the focused verification allowlist" — and leave the operator to work
out the syntax, the file and the right breadth. It now carries the remedy, so
the agent can relay it and the operator can read it in the log:

```
Tool 'bash' denied by connectonion.auto: sending mail requires human approval;
no approval channel is available

Nothing has granted this. To allow it — including unattended — write it down once:
  • in .co/host.yaml:
      permissions:
        "Bash(co email send *)":
          allowed: true
          source: config
          reason: why you want this
          expires:
            type: never
  • or in the skill that needs it, in its SKILL.md frontmatter:
      tools:
        - "Bash(co email send *)"
```

The suggested pattern errs narrow: it is the leading verb words, stopping at
the first argument-looking one and capped at three, so `co email send --to …`
suggests `Bash(co email send *)` rather than `Bash(co *)`. For a deletion, a
credential or a payment it names the command exactly — `rm -rf build` suggests
`Bash(rm -rf build)`, because `Bash(rm *)` would also cover `rm -rf /` and a
suggestion is a nudge toward whatever it prints.

### Unattended pipelines

For a scheduled run, put the grant in the skill that needs it. `tools:` in the
SKILL.md frontmatter is scoped to the turn the skill runs in, which is the
whole of a one-shot `co ai "/my-skill"`, and it keeps the declaration next to
the procedure that depends on it:

```yaml
---
name: daily-digest
description: Email me what happened today.
tools:
  - "Bash(co email send *)"
---
```

`.co/host.yaml` is the other place, for grants that outlive any one skill.
Either way it is written down once and the pipeline stops stopping.

### Configuration

Add permissions to `.co/host.yaml`:

```yaml
# .co/host.yaml
permissions:
  # Simple tool name - matches any call
  "read_file":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe read operation
    expires:
      type: never

  # Exact bash command
  "Bash(git status)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git read
    expires:
      type: never

  # Wildcard - matches command prefix
  "Bash(git diff *)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git diff
    expires:
      type: never

  # Parameter matching - file pattern
  "write":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe doc edits
    when:
      file_path: "*.md"
    expires:
      type: never
```

### Pattern Types

**Simple Tool Name**
```yaml
"read_file":  # Matches any call to read_file
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe read operation
  expires:
    type: never
```

**Exact Bash Command**
```yaml
"Bash(git status)":  # Only matches exact command
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe git read
  expires:
    type: never
```

**Wildcard Bash Command**
```yaml
"Bash(git diff *)":  # Matches any command starting with "git diff "
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe git diff
  expires:
    type: never
```

**Parameter Matching**
```yaml
"write":
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe doc edits
  when:
    file_path: "*.md"  # Only matches write calls to *.md files
  expires:
    type: never
```

### Default Permissions

The template `host.yaml` includes safe read-only commands that are auto-approved:

**System Information:**
- `pwd`, `ls`, `uname`, `lscpu`, `free`, `df` - Basic system info
- `top`, `ps`, `uptime` - Process and system monitoring
- `whoami`, `hostname`, `date` - User and time info
- `which`, `env` - Environment info

**macOS Specific:**
- `sw_vers`, `system_profiler` - macOS version and hardware
- `sysctl`, `vm_stat` - System control and memory stats

**Git Read Commands:**
- `git status`, `git diff *`, `git log *`, `git branch *`

**Testing:**
- `pytest *`, `npm test`

**Utilities:**
- `cat *`, `grep *`, `perl *`

All commands are whitelisted for bash command chains - if ALL commands in a chain are permitted, the entire chain is auto-approved.

### Priority Order

Config permissions integrate with the existing approval system:

1. **Template permissions** - Explicit built-in allowlist (`source: safe`)
2. **Config permissions** - Loaded from host.yaml (`source: config`)
3. **Skill permissions** - Temporary, turn-scoped (`source: skill`)
4. **Session approvals** - User approved for session (`source: user`)
5. **Runtime approval** - Ask user for every remaining live-IO tool

### Terminal Logging

```
⚡ Bash(git status) (safe git read)    # Auto-approved from config
⚡ write (safe doc edits)              # Auto-approved from config (matched *.md)
✓ bash approved (session)              # User approved (not in config)
```

### Examples

**Development Agent**
```yaml
permissions:
  "Bash(git status)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git read
    expires:
      type: never
  "Bash(git diff *)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git diff
    expires:
      type: never
  "Bash(pytest *)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe tests
    expires:
      type: never
```

**Documentation Agent**
```yaml
permissions:
  "write":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: doc updates
    when:
      file_path: "docs/**/*.md"
    expires:
      type: never
  "edit":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: doc updates
    when:
      file_path: "docs/**/*.md"
    expires:
      type: never
```

## Bash Command Chain Permissions

Uses **bashlex** to parse and validate command chains. ALL subcommands must match a permission — one unlisted command rejects the whole chain.

### How It Works

When bash executes `pwd && ls -F`:

1. **Parse** with bashlex → `[("pwd", "pwd"), ("ls", "ls -F")]` — full subcommand text, including args
2. **Check** each subcommand against permissions using `fnmatch`
3. **Approve** only if ALL subcommands match a permission
4. **Reject** if ANY subcommand has no matching permission

Each subcommand is matched as its full text (e.g. `"ls -F"`), not just the command name (`"ls"`). This means:

- `Bash(ls *)` matches `ls -F` ✅ — wildcard covers the args
- `Bash(ls *)` does NOT match bare `ls` ❌ — no args after the space
- `Bash(git diff *)` matches `git diff --staged` ✅
- `Bash(git diff *)` does NOT match `git status` ❌

### `when` Field at Runtime

When a `Bash(X)` pattern is loaded from config, it is stored internally as a `bash` key with a `when: {command: X}` field. At runtime this field is validated against the **full subcommand** via `fnmatch`:

```yaml
# In host.yaml
"Bash(git diff *)":
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe git diff
```

Internally becomes:
```python
{'bash': {'allowed': True, 'when': {'command': 'git diff *'}}}
```

At runtime:
- `git diff --staged` → `fnmatch("git diff --staged", "git diff *")` → ✅ permitted
- `git status`       → `fnmatch("git status", "git diff *")` → ❌ rejected
- `timeout 300 bash script.sh` → `fnmatch("timeout 300 bash script.sh", "git diff *")` → ❌ rejected

This prevents a `bash` key from becoming a wildcard that approves any command.

### Examples

**✅ All Permitted:**
```yaml
permissions:
  "Bash(pwd)":   {allowed: true, ...}
  "Bash(ls *)":  {allowed: true, ...}
```

Command: `pwd && ls -F`
- ✅ `pwd` matches `Bash(pwd)` exactly
- ✅ `ls -F` matches `Bash(ls *)` via wildcard
- **Result:** Auto-approved ⚡

**❌ Partial Permission:**
```yaml
permissions:
  "Bash(pwd)": {allowed: true, ...}
  # rm is NOT whitelisted
```

Command: `pwd && rm -rf /`
- ✅ `pwd` permitted
- ❌ `rm -rf /` has no matching permission
- **Result:** Requires approval ⚠️

### Supported Syntax

bashlex handles all bash constructs:

| Syntax | Example | Subcommands Extracted |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| AND (`&&`) | `pwd && ls -F` | `[("pwd","pwd"), ("ls","ls -F")]` |
| OR (`\|\|`) | `test -f f \|\| echo no` | `[("test","test -f f"), ("echo","echo no")]` |
| Pipe (`\|`) | `cat file \| grep test` | `[("cat","cat file"), ("grep","grep test")]` |
| Semicolon (`;`) | `echo a; echo b` | `[("echo","echo a"), ("echo","echo b")]` |

### Security

**Whitelist-first:** One dangerous command = whole chain rejected.

```bash
# ❌ REJECTED even though pwd is safe
pwd && rm -rf /
```

## Client Protocol

### Server sends

```json
{
  "type": "approval_needed",
  "tool": "bash",
  "arguments": {"command": "npm install"},
  "batch_remaining": [{"tool": "write", "arguments": "..."}]
}
```

### Client responds

```json
{"approved": true, "scope": "once"}
{"approved": true, "scope": "session"}
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_soft", "feedback": "Use yarn instead"}
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_hard", "feedback": "Wrong approach"}
```

## Approval Scopes

| Scope | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `once` | Approve this call only |
| `session` | Approve for rest of session (stored in memory) |

## Terminal Logging

```
✓ bash approved (session)    # Approved with session scope
✓ edit approved (once)       # Approved for single use
⏭ bash (session-approved)    # Skipped (already approved)
✗ bash rejected: Use yarn    # Rejected with feedback
✗ bash - connection closed   # WebSocket closed
```

## Events

| Handler | Event | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `check_approval` | `before_each_tool` | Check approval and prompt client |

## Session Data

```python
# Approval state stored in session
agent.current_session['approval'] = {
    'approved_tools': {
        'bash': 'session',
        'write': 'session'
    }
}

# Set by reject_hard — remaining tools in batch see this and auto-reject
agent.current_session['stop_signal'] = "User rejected tool 'bash'."
```

## Non-Web Mode

When `agent.io` is None (not web mode), all tools execute without approval. This is the default behavior for CLI usage.
