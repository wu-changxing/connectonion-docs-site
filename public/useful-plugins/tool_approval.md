# tool_approval

Web-based approval for dangerous tools via WebSocket. Requires user confirmation before executing tools that can modify files or run commands.

## Quick Start

```python
from connectonion import Agent, bash
from connectonion.useful_plugins import tool_approval

agent = Agent("assistant", tools=[bash], plugins=[tool_approval])
agent.io = my_websocket_io  # Required for web mode

agent.input("Install dependencies")
# → Client receives: {"type": "approval_needed", "tool": "bash", "arguments": {"command": "npm install"}}
# → Client responds: {"approved": true, "scope": "session"}
# ✓ bash approved (session)
```

## Lifecycle

```
User sends prompt
    ↓
Agent calls LLM
    ↓
LLM returns tool_calls batch: [bash("npm install"), write("config.json"), bash("npm build")]
    ↓
tool_executor iterates sequentially:
    ↓
┌─ Tool #1: bash("npm install")
│   before_each_tool fires → check_approval()
│   → Is it safe? No (bash is DANGEROUS)
│   → Already approved for session? No
│   → Send to client:
│       {
│         "type": "approval_needed",
│         "tool": "bash",
│         "arguments": {"command": "npm install"},
│         "batch_remaining": [
│           {"tool": "write", "arguments": "{...}"},
│           {"tool": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"npm build\"}"}
│         ]
│       }
│   → BLOCK — wait for client response
│   ↓
│   Client responds: {"approved": true, "scope": "session"}
│   → Execute bash("npm install")
│   → Save "bash" as session-approved
│
├─ Tool #2: write("config.json")
│   before_each_tool fires → check_approval()
│   → Is it safe? No (write is DANGEROUS)
│   → Send approval_needed (batch_remaining: [bash(...)])
│   → Client responds: {"approved": false, "mode": "reject_soft"}
│   → Skip this tool, continue to next
│
├─ Tool #3: bash("npm build")
│   before_each_tool fires → check_approval()
│   → bash is session-approved → skip approval, execute immediately
│
└─ Done. Return results to LLM.
```

## Rejection Modes

When the client rejects a tool, the `mode` field determines what happens next:

### reject_soft (Skip)

Skip this tool, agent loop continues. The LLM receives a hint to ask the user what they prefer.

```json
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_soft", "feedback": "Don't write that file"}
```

- Current tool is skipped (raises ValueError)
- Next tool in the batch proceeds normally
- LLM gets: `"User rejected tool 'write'. Feedback: Don't write that file\n\n[System reminder: Ask the user...]"`

### reject_hard (Stop)

Skip this tool AND all remaining tools in the batch. The agent loop stops and waits for new user input.

```json
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_hard", "feedback": "Wrong approach entirely"}
```

- Current tool is skipped (raises ValueError)
- `stop_signal` flag is set in session
- All remaining tools in the batch are auto-rejected
- Agent loop stops — LLM does NOT get another turn
- User must send a new message to continue

Default mode when `mode` is not provided: `reject_hard`.

## Batch Context

When a tool needs approval, the server includes `batch_remaining` — a list of tools that will execute after the current one. This gives the client an overview to make informed decisions.

```json
{
  "type": "approval_needed",
  "tool": "bash",
  "arguments": {"command": "npm install"},
  "batch_remaining": [
    {"tool": "write", "arguments": "{\"file_path\": \"config.json\", ...}"},
    {"tool": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"npm build\"}"}
  ]
}
```

`batch_remaining` is only present when there are more tools after the current one. For the last tool in a batch (or a single-tool call), it is omitted.

## Tool Classification

### Safe Tools (No Approval)

Read-only operations that never modify state:

```
read, read_file, glob, grep, search
list_files, get_file_info, task, load_guide
enter_plan_mode, exit_plan_mode, write_plan
task_output, ask_user
```

### Dangerous Tools (Require Approval)

Operations that can modify files or have side effects:

```
bash, shell, run, run_in_dir
write, edit, multi_edit
run_background, kill_task
send_email, post, delete, remove
```

### Unknown Tools

Tools not in either list are treated as safe (no approval needed).

## Config-Based Auto-Approval

Auto-approve safe commands permanently via `host.yaml` configuration. Config permissions never expire and apply to all sessions.

### Configuration

Add permissions to `.co/host.yaml`:

```yaml
# .co/host.yaml
permissions:
  # Simple tool name - matches any call
  "read_file":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe read operation
    expires:
      type: never

  # Exact bash command
  "Bash(git status)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git read
    expires:
      type: never

  # Wildcard - matches command prefix
  "Bash(git diff *)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git diff
    expires:
      type: never

  # Parameter matching - file pattern
  "write":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe doc edits
    when:
      file_path: "*.md"
    expires:
      type: never
```

### Pattern Types

**Simple Tool Name**
```yaml
"read_file":  # Matches any call to read_file
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe read operation
  expires:
    type: never
```

**Exact Bash Command**
```yaml
"Bash(git status)":  # Only matches exact command
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe git read
  expires:
    type: never
```

**Wildcard Bash Command**
```yaml
"Bash(git diff *)":  # Matches any command starting with "git diff "
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe git diff
  expires:
    type: never
```

**Parameter Matching**
```yaml
"write":
  allowed: true
  source: config
  reason: safe doc edits
  when:
    file_path: "*.md"  # Only matches write calls to *.md files
  expires:
    type: never
```

### Default Permissions

The template `host.yaml` includes safe read-only commands that are auto-approved:

**System Information:**
- `pwd`, `ls`, `uname`, `lscpu`, `free`, `df` - Basic system info
- `top`, `ps`, `uptime` - Process and system monitoring
- `whoami`, `hostname`, `date` - User and time info
- `which`, `env` - Environment info

**macOS Specific:**
- `sw_vers`, `system_profiler` - macOS version and hardware
- `sysctl`, `vm_stat` - System control and memory stats

**Git Read Commands:**
- `git status`, `git diff *`, `git log *`, `git branch *`

**Testing:**
- `pytest *`, `npm test`

**Utilities:**
- `cat *`, `grep *`, `perl *`

All commands are whitelisted for bash command chains - if ALL commands in a chain are permitted, the entire chain is auto-approved.

### Priority Order

Config permissions integrate with the existing approval system:

1. **Safe tools** - Always approved (SAFE_TOOLS list)
2. **Config permissions** - Loaded from host.yaml (`source: config`)
3. **Skill permissions** - Temporary, turn-scoped (`source: skill`)
4. **Session approvals** - User approved for session (`source: user`)
5. **Runtime approval** - Ask user (if none of above match)

### Terminal Logging

```
⚡ Bash(git status) (safe git read)    # Auto-approved from config
⚡ write (safe doc edits)              # Auto-approved from config (matched *.md)
✓ bash approved (session)              # User approved (not in config)
```

### Examples

**Development Agent**
```yaml
permissions:
  "Bash(git status)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git read
    expires:
      type: never
  "Bash(git diff *)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe git diff
    expires:
      type: never
  "Bash(pytest *)":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: safe tests
    expires:
      type: never
```

**Documentation Agent**
```yaml
permissions:
  "write":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: doc updates
    when:
      file_path: "docs/**/*.md"
    expires:
      type: never
  "edit":
    allowed: true
    source: config
    reason: doc updates
    when:
      file_path: "docs/**/*.md"
    expires:
      type: never
```

## Bash Command Chain Permissions

Uses **bashlex** to parse and validate command chains - ALL commands must be permitted.

### How It Works

When bash executes `pwd && ls -F`:

1. **Parse** with bashlex → `["pwd", "ls"]`
2. **Check** each command against permissions
3. **Approve** only if ALL commands are whitelisted
4. **Reject** if ANY command lacks permission

### Examples

**✅ All Permitted:**
```yaml
permissions:
  "Bash(pwd)": {allowed: true, ...}
  "Bash(ls *)": {allowed: true, ...}
```

Command: `pwd && ls -F`
- ✅ pwd permitted
- ✅ ls permitted
- **Result:** Auto-approved ⚡

**❌ Partial Permission:**
```yaml
permissions:
  "Bash(pwd)": {allowed: true, ...}
  # rm is NOT whitelisted
```

Command: `pwd && rm -rf /`
- ✅ pwd permitted
- ❌ rm NOT permitted
- **Result:** Requires approval ⚠️

### Supported Syntax

bashlex handles all bash constructs:

| Syntax | Example | Commands Extracted |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| AND (`&&`) | `pwd && ls` | `["pwd", "ls"]` |
| OR (`\|\|`) | `test -f file \|\| echo no` | `["test", "echo"]` |
| Pipe (`\|`) | `cat file \| grep test` | `["cat", "grep"]` |
| Semicolon (`;`) | `echo a; echo b` | `["echo", "echo"]` |
| Complex | `sw_vers; df -h \| grep /` | `["sw_vers", "df", "grep"]` |

### Security

**Whitelist-first:** One dangerous command = whole chain rejected.

```bash
# ❌ REJECTED even though pwd is safe
pwd && rm -rf /
```

## Client Protocol

### Server sends

```json
{
  "type": "approval_needed",
  "tool": "bash",
  "arguments": {"command": "npm install"},
  "batch_remaining": [{"tool": "write", "arguments": "..."}]
}
```

### Client responds

```json
{"approved": true, "scope": "once"}
{"approved": true, "scope": "session"}
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_soft", "feedback": "Use yarn instead"}
{"approved": false, "mode": "reject_hard", "feedback": "Wrong approach"}
```

## Approval Scopes

| Scope | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `once` | Approve this call only |
| `session` | Approve for rest of session (stored in memory) |

## Terminal Logging

```
✓ bash approved (session)    # Approved with session scope
✓ edit approved (once)       # Approved for single use
⏭ bash (session-approved)    # Skipped (already approved)
✗ bash rejected: Use yarn    # Rejected with feedback
✗ bash - connection closed   # WebSocket closed
```

## Events

| Handler | Event | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `check_approval` | `before_each_tool` | Check approval and prompt client |

## Session Data

```python
# Approval state stored in session
agent.current_session['approval'] = {
    'approved_tools': {
        'bash': 'session',
        'write': 'session'
    }
}

# Set by reject_hard — remaining tools in batch see this and auto-reject
agent.current_session['stop_signal'] = "User rejected tool 'bash'."
```

## Non-Web Mode

When `agent.io` is None (not web mode), all tools execute without approval. This is the default behavior for CLI usage.
